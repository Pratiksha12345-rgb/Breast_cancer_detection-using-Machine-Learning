# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and selecting the most significant attributes.  
A **Decision Tree Classifier** is applied to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant**, supporting early diagnosis and treatment planning.
